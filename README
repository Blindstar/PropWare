PropWare - README
Author:	 David Zemon
Purpose: Generic C library files for the Parallax Propeller Microcontroller

TODO:
	- SD & FAT16/32 driver
		- Write files
			- Write blocks (low level SD)
		- Traverse directories (implies ability to open files/directories not
		  in the current directory)
	- Created shared library file(s)
		- ***Likely not going to happen: pre-compiled files implies an
		  inability to have pre-processor optimizations
	- Re-create SPI library to use inline assembly and FCACHE instead of
	  a second cog
	- Add "SPIShiftOut_Fast" and "SPIShiftIn_Fast" functions that do not use
	  a delay in for the clock - useful for SD card read/write
	- Add "SPIShiftIn_Multi", which will repeatedly shift in values and allow
	  for the selection between *_Fast or normal using a parameter

Further description will come soon...
